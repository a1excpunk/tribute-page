        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino">
            Tarantino was born on
            March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee, the only child of Connie Pender and Tony Tarantino, an actor and
            producer. His father is of Italian descent, and his mother has Irish ancestry. He was named for Quint
            Asper, Burt Reynolds' character in the CBS series Gunsmoke. Tarantino's mother met his father during a
            trip to Los Angeles, where Tony was a law student and would-be entertainer. She married him soon after, to
            gain independence from her parents, but their marriage was brief. After the divorce, Connie Tarantino left
            Los Angeles and moved to Knoxville, where her parents lived. In 1966, Tarantino and his mother moved back to
            Los Angeles. <br> <br> His films are characterized by nonlinear
            storylines, aestheticization of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts, references to popular
            culture and a wide variety of other films, soundtracks primarily containing songs and score pieces from the
            1960s to the 1980s, alternate history, and features of neo-noir film. <br> He began his career as an
            independent filmmaker with the release of Reservoir Dogs in 1992, which was funded by money from the sale of
            his screenplay True Romance (1993). Empire magazine hailed Reservoir Dogs as the "Greatest Independent Film
            of All Time". His second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a crime comedy, was a major success both among critics
            and audiences. He also wrote the screenplay for the horror comedy film From Dusk till Dawn (1996),
            in which he also starred. Tarantino paid homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s with Jackie Brown
            (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch. <br>
            In 2003, Tarantino delivered Kill Bill: Volume 1, a highly stylized "revenge flick" in the cinematic
            traditions of kung fu films and Japanese martial arts; Volume 2 followed in 2004. Tarantino next directed
            the exploitation slasher film Death Proof (2007), part of a double feature with Robert Rodriguez released in
            the tradition of 1970s grindhouse cinema under the collective title Grindhouse. His long-postponed
            Inglourious Basterds (2009) tells an alternate history of Allied forces in Nazi Germany, and was released to
            critical acclaim. He followed that with another critical success, Django Unchained (2012), a Spaghetti
            Western set in the Antebellum South. His eighth film, The Hateful Eight (2015), was a long-form Western
            initially screened in a 70 mm roadshow theatrical release. His ninth film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood
            (2019), recounts an alternate history of events surrounding the Tateâ€“LaBianca murders.</blockquote>
