        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino">
          Tarantino was born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee, the
          only child of Connie Pender and Tony Tarantino, an actor and producer.
          His father is of Italian descent, and his mother has Irish ancestry.
          He was named for Quint Asper, Burt Reynolds' character in the CBS
          series Gunsmoke. Tarantino's mother met his father during a trip to
          Los Angeles, where Tony was a law student and would-be entertainer.
          She married him soon after, to gain independence from her parents, but
          their marriage was brief. After the divorce, Connie Tarantino left Los
          Angeles and moved to Knoxville, where her parents lived. In 1966,
          Tarantino and his mother moved back to Los Angeles. <br />
          <br />
          His films are characterized by nonlinear storylines, aestheticization
          of violence, extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts, references
          to popular culture and a wide variety of other films, soundtracks
          primarily containing songs and score pieces from the 1960s to the
          1980s, alternate history, and features of neo-noir film. <br />
          He began his career as an independent filmmaker with the release of
          Reservoir Dogs in 1992, which was funded by money from the sale of his
          screenplay True Romance (1993). Empire magazine hailed Reservoir Dogs
          as the "Greatest Independent Film of All Time". His second film, Pulp
          Fiction (1994), a crime comedy, was a major success both among critics
          and audiences. He also wrote the screenplay for the horror comedy film
          From Dusk till Dawn (1996), in which he also starred. Tarantino paid
          homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s with Jackie Brown
          (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch. <br />
          In 2003, Tarantino delivered Kill Bill: Volume 1, a highly stylized
          "revenge flick" in the cinematic traditions of kung fu films and
          Japanese martial arts; Volume 2 followed in 2004. Tarantino next
          directed the exploitation slasher film Death Proof (2007), part of a
          double feature with Robert Rodriguez released in the tradition of
          1970s grindhouse cinema under the collective title Grindhouse. His
          long-postponed Inglourious Basterds (2009) tells an alternate history
          of Allied forces in Nazi Germany, and was released to critical
          acclaim. He followed that with another critical success, Django
          Unchained (2012), a Spaghetti Western set in the Antebellum South. His
          eighth film, The Hateful Eight (2015), was a long-form Western
          initially screened in a 70 mm roadshow theatrical release. His ninth
          film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), recounts an alternate
          history of events surrounding the Tateâ€“LaBianca murders.
